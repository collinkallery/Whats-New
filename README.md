# What's New?

### Abstract

"What's New" was assigned to us at Turing School of Software & Design during our first week of our third quarter of the program. This was a solo project where we needed to create a news application, where a user can see different news stories based on categories, like Local News, Entertainment, and Technology. The user is also able to search through a given category of articles based on headline keyword.

### Objectives

1. Implement the React Framework in place of our traditionally used Vanilla JS.
2. Utilize React's testing libraries to ensure each component's ability to display the necessary data / text.
3. Get acquainted with the use of JSX to write JavaScript expressions within React's render method

### Challenges & Looking Ahead

This project was a really great experiment, considering it was my first time using the React framework. The learning curve felt steep initially, but it wasn't long until I began to recognize the true benefits of utilizing a framework like React over traditional implementation via Vanilla JavaScript. I've built out quite a few applications of this size or larger throughout my career at Turing, and after using React, I felt a major increase in efficiency and productivity. The framework makes building applications significantly more intuitive and fast. There were however, a few challenges that were primarily circumstantial. In our intermission between quarters at Turing, we are typically assigned pre-work. To get myself well-acquainted with React, I spent almost that entire week studying and didn't give myself a proper break from the material. As a result, I felt quite burned out while moving through this project and my degree of professionalism was lacking - specifically in regards to git and organization. I did not use branches, a PR template, and submitted very large commits.

Moving forward, I would like to dedicate more time to testing - I feel relatively well-adjusted to React's testing libraries, but would like some more practice. Also, I'd like to focus a bit more on an increase of complexity into the app - adding some more user-friendly features, so that I could get some more practice using components with React. I also did not implement any forms of accessibility in this project - there are many divs, and zero ARIA tags. 

### Set Up

Clone down this repo.

1. On GitHub, create a new, empty repository and name it something like 'whats-new'.
2. Update the current remote (called "origin") so that it points at the URL of the repository you just created on GitHub. Read how to do this [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/changing-a-remotes-url).
3. Once you've updated the remote, you should run `npm install`, commit, and then push your initial commit to your personal repository. You will need to use the `-u` flag when you push (like this: `git push -u origin master`).
4. Run `npm start` to start up your React server. (You will see errors!)
